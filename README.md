# Name
Multi-layer Perceptron

# Summary
A basic 3-layer Neural Network

# Description
This project is based on a Youtube tutorial series from The Coding Train.

In this project, I will be putting together my own Neural Network library for use in other p5.js projects. The reason for p5.js is its ease of implementation into a quickly testable development environment.

# Notes
This project is incomplete, and under irregular development. For the completed repo, check out The Coding Train's website which contains all the files and information.
